            <h3>MY INTEREST: FASHION STYLING</h3> 
            
            <p></p>

            <p>Fashion has always been a way for me to express myself, and I love curating unique outfits that tell a story.  
                My goal is to become a stylist for athletes, allowing me to merge my two biggest passions; fashion and sports.</p>
     
             <p>Style plays a huge role in how athletes present themselves both on and off the court. I want to help create iconic 
                looks that reflect their personalities while making bold fashion statements.
            </p>


            <p>
                At Northeastern, I have styled a fashion show for The Fashion Society which
                is one of the main fashion clubs on campus. I have also used my minor 
                in Global Fashion studies to help me learn more about the fashion world
                and the things I can do to accomplish my career goal.
            </p>

            <p>I currently intern part time for an established stylist so I hope this role puts
                me a step towards achieving my goals.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another reason I love the fashion field is because of how capable it is to incorporate it into other fields.
                For example, as a Computer Science major, there are many ways I can combine both fashion and technology 
                together. There is an increase in wearable tech which allows for creativity.
                Additionally, I am excited to see how AI will be used in the future in conjunction with fashion.
            </p>
