            <h2>About Me</h2>  

            <p>My name is <span class="highlight">Jessica</span>, and I am from NYC. I am 21 years old.  
                My interests revolve around the sports and fashion world.  
                I love thrifting, putting outfits together and dressing up! 
                
                I also listen to a variety of music and love trying new kinds of food, reading fashion blogs and also learning about crypto currencies.
            
                My favorite sport is <span class="highlight">Basketball</span>, and my career goal is to become a stylist for athletes.  
            </p>


            <p>I am currently in my fourth year at Northeastern University, where I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science & Business 
                Administration with a concentration in Brand Management as well as a minor in Global Fashion 
                Studies. My academic journey has been both exciting and rewarding, allowing me 
                to explore different fields. Alongside my studies, I have participated in multiple internships and co-op programs that have 
                given me valuable industry experience and insight. Throughout these opportunities, I have learned a lot about my passions, and 
                they have helped shape my career aspirations.</p>
           
            
            <p>
                In the summer of my sophomore year, I was IT intern at a
                cosmetics company called tarte. I realized that I do not like the corporate type of environment and work structure.

                In my Third year, I did my co-op at a Fashion Public Relations Firm in NYC
             </p>

            <p> I also love cars! Some of my favorites include variations of <span class="highlight">Dodge sports cars</span>, like the Challenger,  
                and recently, the <span class="highlight">Tesla Cybertruck</span>. I realize that I am drawn to cars with unorthodox silhouettes.
